### Hey everyone!  
I'm Anoushka Ramesh and welcome to my blog! I always fantasized about having my own blog but never really got down to doing it until now. This would be a designated space to pen down my thoughts and ideas which usually come up in random spurts. But to give you an idea, they'll revolve around my college life (or whatever's left of it at this time of the pandemic), technology, art, books or sometimes, just old-fashioned life advice.  

Either way, I do hope you'll stick around to hear some perspective on life from a 19 year old's mind. Happy reading!
