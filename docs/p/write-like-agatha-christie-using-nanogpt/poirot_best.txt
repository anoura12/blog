Title: "The Enigmatic Garden Murder"

In the sleepy village of Willowbrook, nestled amidst rolling hills and lush greenery, a group of friends gathers for their annual garden party. Lady Margaret Hastings, the elegant hostess known for her exquisite rose garden, has invited her closest friends and neighbors to revel in the beauty of her estate.        

As the afternoon sun bathes the garden in a warm, golden glow, a small, young man arrives in a beige chauffeur's car and picks up a young woman from the carousel. He smiles broadly and informs her that the afternoon's guests are all her relatives. They are not the sort of people she is used to seeing, however, and they demand to know where she is going. The young man reluctantly responds that she is going to the cottage of the Duke of Douglas.

The Duchess appears with her husband at once, but when the young man insists on taking his leave, she hesitates. Despite her chagrin, she gives him the keys to the cottage and asks him to escort her out.

Murdered: A Girl Who Loved the Water

The young man emerges from the cottage in a raincoat and comes out into the alleyway with his mistress. They approach each other.

"I should like to ask you something," he says. "You're going to the cottage of the Duke of Douglas?"

"Yes, I am."

"But what is the purpose for your visit?"

"I want to find out more about the painting in the house. It was a gift from a friend of mine. He did not appreciate the painting quite as I do."

"He very nearly had it," replied the maid. "He had an obstinate and irritable temper."

"But how could he have done it?" asked the young man anxiously.

Dowager Margaret Hastings took a deep breath. "Well, he said it was too big and too much of a pain to take to get rid of it. He thought it too much like a picture that belonged to his parents. He said he would prefer to have it cleaned up. So he finally decided to destroy it."

"Is that all?" inquired the maid, incredulously. "But how?"

"Oh, it's not so terrible," replied Margaret Hastings with a smile. "It just took so long for him to kill the painting, and he was an old hand at that time, so he got in a little bit of trouble and had to meet with a certain fate."

"You mean, he got caught up in it?" asked the maid. "Surely you didn't mean to kill him in the first place, did you? Why would you do such a thing?"

"Miss Bates, I was merely trying to amuse myself; you see, when the painting was at my disposal, I took it out and examined it closely, and I thought there was no danger to life or limb. But, as I said, the Duke of Douglas has a temper, and, as a result, he was very angry. Of course he pushed me aside and, when I tried to get away, he caught me up."

"That's all right, my dear lady. You don't see any danger in it?"

"No, my dear Bates; it was simply a natural, even amusing thing that occurred. I didn't blame him for it. His temper was like mine. It's all right to be angry sometimes, and sometimes one is. In this case, it seems to me that he was quite justified. I had a pretty good instinct about such things; I knew the Duke of Douglas personally, and, of course, he was no friend of mine. He was a good man, a sensible man, and he knew he was not to blame for what had happened."

 Douglas personally, and, of course, he was no friend of mine. He was a good man, a sensible man, and he knew he was not to blame for what had happened."

"And it was, indeed, your husband who had fallen into the trap?" asked the maid. "Did you say that he had fallen into the trap?"

"Not the trap myself, Miss Bates. But the Duke of Douglas has the right to dispose of the painting."

"But why?" asked the maid in surprise. "Doesn't he have the right to dispose of the painting?"

"Yes; he did have the right to dispose of it," said Margaret Hastings with a gentle smile. "There are rules governing this matter, Miss Bates; one must be content if one possesses no means of disposing of a work of art because it is his--and somebody else's--property. There are no grounds for anger in this matter."
The maid began to tremble. "Oh, my God!" she cried. "You're quite right! I have never erred in my life. I really believe the Duke of Douglas is guilty of murder!"

The maid's despair was quickly quelled. "I think," said Margaret Hastings, "that your husband may have been justified. I really do. But that is the trouble: the Duke of Douglas has no right to dispose of the painting unless he has the right to dispose of it."

"But what of, Miss Bates?"

"And what of the Duke of
