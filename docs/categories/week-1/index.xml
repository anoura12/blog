      <description>GSoC 2021: Congratulations, your proposal with INCF has been accepted!  I honestly couldnâ€™t believe it. Till 11:17 PM that day, I was ridden with anxiety but it was all worth it when I finally saw the awaited email. Hours spent in proposal writing, maintaining constant communication with the project leads and handling ongoing uncertainties until now finally paid off.
 GSoC 2021 
The 2 month long project involves building a working prototype of AutSPACEs - a citizen science, participatory platform for, with and by the autistic community.</description>
